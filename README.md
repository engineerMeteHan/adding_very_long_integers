# adding_very_long_integers
In this example, we will deal with pointer arithmetic  
 and string. The example program given in this section  
 takes as input two long integers seperated by "+" and  
 displays their sum. Each of these numbers can be up to 
 80 digit long; Thus, The maximum total to be obtained  
 is 81 digits. When displaying the total, unnecessary   
 zeros on the left are skipped.
